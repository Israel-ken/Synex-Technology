# Synex Technology — Startup Site

This is a minimal static site optimized for Netlify deployment. It includes Home, About, Services, Products, Blog, and Contact sections. The contact form is configured to work with Netlify Forms.

Quick deploy:

1. Push this folder to a Git repo.
2. Connect the repository in the Netlify dashboard.
3. Set the build directory to the project root (default for this template).

Local preview:

Open `index.html` in your browser or run a static server such as:

```bash
npx http-server . -o
```
